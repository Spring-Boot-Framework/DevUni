**Problem:**

DevUni is an online platform for tutoring.
It enables everyone who decide to engage in programming to enroll in courses in one of the leading programming languages. 
DevUni also enables non-registered users to browse across the web page. They can see all courses and detailed information for every single one of them. 
In Devuni there are various roles with different degree of responsibility - root admin, admin, teacher and student. 
Students can enroll in courses, watch videos, download assignments and submit their assignments for every lecture.
After successfully completing the tasks (average grade of each submitted assignment is equal or greater than the course pass percentage) the course completed with a pass goes into the completed courses section. 
Students in DevUni also have the opportunity to send teacher requests to admin and after confirmation they get the chance to receive teacher privileges. 
Teachers in this application have the opportunity to create courses which must contain lectures and assignments for every lecture and then rate the submitted homework. 
Every teacher in DevUni is required to have About Me file with self-description and knowledge level. Admins in DevUni can do all studentsâ€™ operations and have some extra functionality. 
The main purpose is to approve teacher requests and newly created courses and promote or demote user privileges. 
The root admin has the same privileges as admin but the difference is that that root admin can't enroll in courses and can make new admin or demote admin privileges.
